Welcome to my little iceberg on GitHub.
I build things, break things and occassionally fix things.

## About me
- I like software that feels simple on the outside and solid on the inside.
- I enjoy moving between frontend polish and backend structure.
- I learn best by building weird little projects and improving them in public.

## My Fish Crate

| Zone | Tools I use |
| --- | --- |
| **Languages** | JavaScript, Python, HTML/CSS, Java |
| **Frameworks** | Express |
| **Tools** | Git, GitHub Actions, Docker |

> If it saves time, improves clarity, or removes repetition, I’m probably into it.

## What I’m Working On
- Sharpening backend and automation skills
- Building small, practical projects end-to-end
- Staying open to collaboration, feedback, and idea swaps
